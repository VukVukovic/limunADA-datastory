        <div class="col-9 my-auto text-justify">The goal of our project is to investigate what are the topics and the problems that US politicians have addressed the most in the period of 2015 until the April of 2020. For this purpose, we used the Quotebank dataset that consists of more than 178M quotations extracted from English articles. We are not only interested to categorize topics, but we also want to dive deeper into specific events that happen during the mentioned period.

          <h4 class="font-raleway color-subtlered">Research questions</h4>
          More specifically, the research questions we are trying to answer are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>What are the major topics addressed among US politicians?</li>
            <li>How does the popularity of these topics change over time? </li>
            <li>Is it possible to detect certain events which justify such trends?</li>
            <li>How much do US parties, Republicans and Democrats, address these problems?</li>
            <li>Is it possible to compare the results with the results from previous research done on this matter?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 class="font-raleway color-subtlered">Methodology</h4>
          Although Jana's mother was worried that her daughter would have to read through 178 million quotations, luckily, we managed to utilize our knowledge from the Applied Data Analysis course! In order to detect major topics addressed among US politicians, we used LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) method. In order to filter the quotations on certain topics, we applied SBERT (Sentence-BERT) model.

        <div class="col-12 text-justify">
          We used LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) method in order to detect the most important topics. We clustered the quotes for each year with the respect to the party separately. Every quote is assigned a probability that it belongs to a particular cluster. One cluster represents one or more topics. It would be perfect if one cluster is only about one particular topic, but of course, this is not the case. By empirical analysis of different numbers of clusters, we have decided to use 8 clusters for this task. For each cluster, keywords that are assigned to the cluster, as well as a topic name (which we derived based on those keywords) are shown. 
<br /><br />
This gives us an insight into what topics were presented mostly in US media. Moreover, it allows us to detect some interesting events. For example, check the year 2018 and Republican's quotations! Isn't it fascinating that there exists a cluster that contains the following keywords: China, trade, war? This clearly shows the importance of the Trade war with China. Many clusters include keywords such as health and budget together. Indeed, the affordability of health care is an important issue in the US.

          In the previous section, we used LDA models for the detection of topics. After analysis of the obtained clusters, we got an impression what are the most addressed topics. Moreover, we see that there are significant overlaps between topics found in LDA clusters and topics from the study performed by the Pew research. For example, according to the Pew research, affordability of healthcare is a big issue in the US, and indeed health and budget are usually in the same clusters. Here, we decided to fix a set of topics, by taking all the topics mentioned in Pew research, but also some topics that we found interesting after analyzing LDA clusters (politics, China, Russia, Korea, etc). We show what were the most popular topics among this given set of topics during the years.

        We compare the results that we got, with the results obtained by previous study conducted by the Pew Research Center, which can be found <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/12/17/views-of-the-major-problems-facing-the-country/" target="_blank">here</a>. They investigated what are the differences in views of the major problems among the Republican and Democrat parties. Problems they observed are climate change, economic inequality, racism, sexism, job opportunities, affordability of college education, affordability of health care, drug addiction, federal budget deficit, terrorism, and illegal immigration. They compare percentages of people in each party that consider each of these problems to be big. We tried to get an estimation of this using a different variable: the percentages of quotations related to each topic (out of all quotations) with regard to the party. The first plot shows topics that are taken more seriously by Democrats, while the second plot shows topics that are taken more seriously by Republicans, according to Pew Research. Let us concentrate on the question of who takes some problems more seriously. It is logical to assume that people from that party would also speak more about such problems. We see that our approach differs from results by the Pew Research Center only in the case of drug addiction and job opportunities. However, we also see that in both of those cases differences among Republicans and Democrats are minimal.

During the following three years we see an almost linear increase in interest in politics, which might imply that parties started their pre-election campaign. So, in 2020, when another election was held, there must have been a huge peak again! However, we see a decrease in the percentages of quotes related to politics. Why is that? Before you think that there is some mistake here, we remind you that these are percentages of quotes that are related to politics. So, in 2020, there must have been some topic that was so important, even more, important than elections in the US. Unfortunately, we all know what that is. The year 2020 will always be known as a year of break out of COVID-19."},

The virus was firstly located in China, and that explains why there is also an increase in the percentage of quotes related to China in 2020, especially when it comes to the republican party. Indeed, Donald Trump was not embarrassed to refer to this virus as a \"Chinese virus\". But, except for this big change in 2020, we also see a peak in 2017. What happened then? The program Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare was formed in 2010 but was facing strong political opposition by the republican party. During his presidency, Donal Trump rescinded the federal tax penalty for violating the individual mandate through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This raised many questions about whether the ACA was still constitutional, which clearly explains this peak."},
      {"topic":"Foreign relations", "data_topics":["korea", "russia", "china"], "text" : "Here we see what were relationships with the following countries. Let us start with the US-Russian relationship. In 2016, US presidential election took place and there was an accusation that Russian officials helped Donald Trump. This was later investigated from 2017 to 2019 by special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who finally managed to prove this. This was also known as a Mueller investigation. As a result, we see a relatively high presence of Russia-related quotations in the media during 2017, 2018, and 2019.<br /> North Korea is another example of a country with complicated relations with the US. In 2017 President Donald Trump stated: \"There will be fire and fury if the isolated nation makes more threats against the United States\". Tensions between North Korea and the US are getting bigger and bigger. In 2018 Trump met with North Korean President Kim Jong-un for the first time. All these events made a huge impact when it comes to media. Tensions were reduced when a Peace treaty between North Korea and the US was signed. Media prefers to report about crisis rather than peace.<br />US-China relations were indeed complicated for the previous several years. Finally, the US relations with China were not very good either. In January 2018, US President Donald Trump began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China, which explains the increase in interest in China. Moreover, this interest explodes in 2019 and 2020 when the COVID-19 breakout happened. "},

Remember that in the elections in 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were running for president. It is logical to assume that republicans did not want Hillary to gain political points because she was a woman, so they had a strong campaign when it came to women's rights."},

Its' activists became involved in elections in 2016, which explains the first peak. Whereas public opinion on Black Lives Matter was net negative in 2018, it grew increasingly popular through 2019 and 2020 which explains the other peak."}
